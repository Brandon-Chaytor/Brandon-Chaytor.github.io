        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          I am 31 years young from Corner Brook, Newfoundland. I love to watch
          b-horror movies with my friends and go to hardcore shows to get thrown
          around in moshpits, you should try it sometime! I also enjoy playing
          video games, throwing weights around, and cooking!

        <p>
          I am super excited about the oppourtinity to be part of Get Coding! I
          am eager to learn new skills, make new friends, and make a careeer out
          of it along the way! This project alone has taught me that coding is
          very fun and rewarding as I can see my work unfold in real time. I
          have always enjoyed using technology and being creative, coding feels
          like the best of both worlds!
